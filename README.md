# plants-vs-zombies react memory game

## About game
This application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events. 
The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
The application keeps track of the user's score.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts
